# Terminal-backgrounds

The project purpose is to collect cmatrix-like programs(I mean, terminal-based programs that run with just an esthetic purpose)
in one repository. I have always a program of this kind running as my desktop background so maybe someone would find this useful.

After I have an stable version, I'll upload it to AUR for faster and easier installation
